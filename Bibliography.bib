	Abstract = {Abstract The trust is always present implicitly in the protocols based on cooperation, in particular, between the entities involved in routing operations in Ad hoc networks. Indeed, as the wireless range of such nodes is limited, the nodes mutually cooperate with their neighbors in order to extend the remote nodes and the entire network. In our work, we are interested by trust as security solution for \{OLSR\} protocol. This approach fits particularly with characteristics of ad hoc networks. Moreover, the explicit trust management allows entities to reason with and about trust, and to take decisions regarding other entities. In this paper, we detail the techniques and the contributions in trust-based security in OLSR. We present trust-based analysis of the \{OLSR\} protocol using trust specification language, and we show how trust-based reasoning can allow each node to evaluate the behavior of the other nodes. After the detection of misbehaving nodes, we propose solutions of prevention and countermeasures to resolve the situations of inconsistency, and counter the malicious nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution taking different simulated attacks scenarios. Our approach brings few modifications and is still compatible with the bare OLSR. },

@article{1580514,
	Abstract = {We present a set of simple techniques for key establishment over a radio link in peer-to-peer networks. Our approach is based on the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol, which is known to be vulnerable to the ``man-in-the-middle'' attack if the two users involved in the protocol do not share any authenticated information about each other (e.g., public keys, certificates, passwords, shared keys, etc.) prior to the protocol execution. In this paper, we solve the problem by leveraging on the natural ability of users to authenticate each other by visual and verbal contact. We propose three techniques: the first is based on visual comparison of short strings, the second on distance bounding, and the third on integrity codes; in each case, the users do not need to enter any password or other data, nor do they need physical or infrared connectivity between their devices. We base our analysis on a well-established methodology that leads us to a rigorous modularization and a thorough robustness proof of our proposal.},

	Abstract = {Ad-hoc interactions between devices over wireless networks present a security problem: the generation of shared secrets to initialize secure communication over a medium that is inherently vulnerable to various attacks. However, these scenarios also offer the potential for physical security of spaces and the use of protocols in which users must visibly demonstrate their involvement to generate an association. The various protocols have different strengths and weaknesses, which make them suitable in different situations. The problem then becomes which to choose. In this chapter we survey the security challenges and some of these protocols, which use various forms of out-of-band exchange to form an association.},

	Abstract = {The pairing problem is to enable two devices, which share no prior context with each other, to agree upon a security association that they can use to protect their subsequent communication. Secure pairing should offer guarantees of the association partner's identity and it should be resistant to eavesdropping or to a man-in the middle attack. We propose a user friendly solution to this problem. Keys extracted from images of the participants are used for authentication. Details of the SAfE pairing system are presented along with a discussion of the security features and a usability analysis},

	Abstract = {Abstract. We propose a way to establish peer-to-peer authenticated communi- cations over an insecure channel by using an extra channel which can authen- ticate very short strings, e.g. 15 bits. We call this SAS-based authentication as for authentication based on Short Authenticated Strings. The extra channel uses a weak notion of authentication in which strings cannot be forged nor modified, but whose delivery can be maliciously stalled, canceled, or replayed. Our protocol is optimal and relies on an extractable or equivocable commitment scheme.
This approach offers an alternative (or complement) to public-key infrastructures, since we no longer need any central authority, and to password-based authenti- cated key exchange, since we no longer need to establish a confidential password. It can be used to establish secure associations in ad-hoc networks. Applications could be the authentication of a public key (e.g. for SSH or PGP) by users over the telephone, the user-aided pairing of wireless (e.g. Bluetooth) devices, or the restore of secure associations in a disaster case, namely when one remote peer had his long-term keys corrupted.},

	Annote = {The paper extended Coffey-Saidha-Newe modal logic to enable to deal with multi-channel protocols. They found that CSN model did not have enough facilities in order to formalize the problems of multi-channel protocols. The author went forward to propose extensions of modelling oob channels, and then straightforwardly they modifed some axioms and introduced a new axiom for secure communication. 

The limitions of this model is a simple channel modelling with no penetrator existance. In fact, their examples just pair to MANA family, which strongly required a private OOB channels. 


How?

Practise:

MANA protocol family are examples of this model

	Annote = {This paper work tried to answer a "do we we auxilary channel for non-prior knowledge authentication protocol" through an extension of BAN logic. In this paper, they formaly pointed that there is no way to provide the belief about the origin of a message. An extension of BAN logic was introduced such as out-of-band channel properties, and a side-channel-communication rule. For demonstrative applications, the works from [] [] was proved under the hood of the logic framework, and the results showed the correct protocols. 

Unfortunately, we digged the same land of this work to reprove the protocol [], yet we supprisingly pointed a vulnerability of it. The issue of the extension logic is that protocol run of both side must play concurrently at the same second, that could be a very strong assumption or a huge limitation of BAN logic.  },

	Abstract = {Abstract The deployment of Internet based applications calls for adequate users management procedures, being online registration a critical element. In this respect, Email Based Identification and Authentication (EBIA) is an outstanding technique due to its usability. However, it does not handle properly some major issues which make it unsuitable for systems where security is of concern. In this work we modify \{EBIA\} to propose a protocol for users registration. Moreover, we assess the security properties of the protocol using the automatic protocol verifier ProVerif. Finally, we show that the modifications applied to \{EBIA\} are necessary to ensure security since, if they are removed, attacks on the protocol are enabled. Our proposal keeps the high usability features of EBIA, while reaching a reasonable security level for many applications. Additionally, it only requires minor modifications to current Internet infrastructures. },

	Abstract = {IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) has emerged as a promising technology to realize ambient intelligence under the vision of the Internet of Things. Under most circumstances, it is imperative that security be addressed from bootstrapping to data transmission. In this paper, we propose a secure bootstrapping scheme that includes mutual authentication and trust evaluation to provide the first security measure for 6LoWPAN. The scheme is based on multi-hop cluster-tree hierarchical topology in which pairwise keys between neighboring nodes and trust paths to the base station (BS) are established at the same time. Mutual authentication that is based on pairing requires only the storage of one key and the exchange of IDs considering the computational complexity of public key algorithms and the frangibility of shared key protocols. Trust evaluation relies on multiple criteria to achieve security and energy efficiency and to balance the whole network. The BS also maintains a dynamic blacklist to prevent denial of service (DoS) attacks. Analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure and scalable. The energy cost in terms of computation and communication as well as storage are also analyzed and compared to that of shared key protocols and public key algorithms through quantitative analysis.},
